This is a Qt based daemon process to handle RP Lidar input and propagate it as a TCP server

The server produces a blob of data on completion of each scan (0 to 360 degrees).

The data is in the format:
  <start marker '!!RP!!'><number of vectors (ushort)><sequence number (ushort)><range (double) ... for the 'number of vectors'>

By default, the number of vectors is 1440, which is a range at each increment of .25째. 
So, the first vector contains the range at 0째, the second as .25째 and so on to 359.75째.

The systemd service unit and the default config file are at the root of the repository, 
The service unit should be placed at /lib/systemd/system, and the config file at /etc/lidar/lidar.conf
